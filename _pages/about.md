Note: Currently, I'm searching for a full time position in astrodynamics, software enginering, or robotics.

Hi! I'm Ghanghoon "Will" Paik, a researcher and engineer specializing in astrodynamics and high-performance computing. My PhD work at Penn State University focused on developing automated mission planning software for multiple gravity assist trajectory design. I combined advanced mathematical modeling, heuristic optimization, and N-body dynamics to create tools that improve the efficiency of interplanetary missions.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to projects at the cutting edge of aerospace and robotics, including designing autonomous vehicles, optimizing quadcopter systems for emergency scenarios, and creating high-performance computing tools to enhance system efficiency. My work has been recognized in international competitions, such as the ESA Global Trajectory Optimization Competition and the NIST First Responder UAS Indoor Challenge.

Whether I’m tackling complex algorithms or designing practical solutions, I aim to bridge theory and application in every project I undertake.
