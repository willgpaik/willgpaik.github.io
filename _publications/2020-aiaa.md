The application of continuous low thrust to a gravity assist can result in extra gain of ∆v after the maneuver. In this paper, low thrust is applied to a gravity assist maneuver around Venus to evaluate possible benefits. Particle swarm optimization is applied to find the optimal sphere-of-influence entry location and the thrust direction and magnitude. Once the full trajectory is determined, the characteristics of both free and thrusted gravity assists are compared to evaluate the benefit of additional thrust over free gravity assist. Thrusted maneuvers show improvement in ∆v gain and closer approach to a planet
