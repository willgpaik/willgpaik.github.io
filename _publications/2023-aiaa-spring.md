In order to design a trajectory for a mission with multiple planetary visits, generating sequences with proper timing is required. In addition to accounting for the planetâ€™s motion, the spacecraft has to meet strict conditions to perform gravity assist maneuvers around multiple planets. Algorithms are considered to determine optimal paths including low-thrust synergetic gravity assist between Earth and a terminal planet. In this paper, development of sequencing methods to design multi-purpose missions, i.e. number of planets to visit or minimize time/fuel to complete a mission, is addressed.
