In order to design a trajectory for a mission with multiple planetary visits, generating sequences with proper timing is required. In addition to accounting for the planet’s motion, the spacecraft has to meet strict conditions to perform gravity assist maneuvers around multiple planets. Algorithms are considered to determine optimal paths including low-thrust synergetic gravity assist between Earth and a terminal planet. In this paper, development of sequencing methods to design multi-purpose missions, i.e. number of planets to visit or minimize time/fuel to complete a mission, is addressed.
