Previous interplanetary missions have used non-powered flyby maneuvers to gain delta-v via gravity assist. In this research, trajectories similar to previous missions are studied to compare the effect of applied continuous thrust while a spacecraft is flying inside a planet’s sphere of influence. Compared to a free flyby, a spacecraft with continuous thrust capability can optimize the path and possibly allow a wider window for mission design. The focus is a proof-of-concept for gravity assists using continuous thrust within the SOI of each encountered planet for a synergetic ∆v. With further development, it is expected to generate optimized trajectories to target a planet with powered gravity assist. In the interplanetary results, the algorithm was able to find a path with two successful powered planetary flybys from a given set of dates.
