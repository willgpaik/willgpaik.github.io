A solution to Lambert’s problem gives the required delta-v to transfer from one point to another in a given time of flight. The porkchop plot is a set of Lambert’s solutions (delta-v’s) within a given range of dates which provides windows of launch or arrival dates. A series of Lambert’s solutions can be used to generate a sequence for multiple planetary visits. In addition to continuous thrust during the flyby phase, layers of porkchop plots can be combined for path planning. This paper introduces an idea to design a gravity assist mission trajectory with applied continuous thrust synergetic maneuvers at the planetary encounters.
