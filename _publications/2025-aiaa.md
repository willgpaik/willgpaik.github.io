The Tisserand graph method can be extended to include impulsive maneuvers performed at the periapsis of planetary flybys. By incorporating velocity changes into the Tisserand graph, the range of accessible transfer arcs is expanded and mission opportunities beyond purely ballistic paths can be found. This approach provides an intuitive tool for visualising v-infinity transitions and designing complex tour sequences involving powered gravity assist trajectories. Time of flight comparisons demonstrate that powered flybys can reduce total mission duration and phasing constraints, through the reduction of repeated flybys of the same planet, offering a practical enhancement to conventional trajectory design techniques.
