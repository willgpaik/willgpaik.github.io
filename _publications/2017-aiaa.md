We present the methods and results of the Astrodynamics Research Group of Penn State (ARGoPS) team in the 2017 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference Student Competition. A mission (named Minerva) was designed to investigate Asteroid (469219) 2016 HO3 in order to determine its mass and volume and to map and characterize its surface. This data would prove useful in determining the necessity and usefulness of future missions to the asteroid. The mission was designed such that a balance between cost and maximizing objectives was found.
